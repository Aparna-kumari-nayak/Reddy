    <p>Nature gifts many benefits to humans.; we breathe air, the water we drink, and the food we eat provides survival. Humans have long felt a connection between health and exposure to nature. For centuries, parks and other green spaces have been interwoven into cities to provide spaces for people to relax and recharge. 

        It is hard to imagine life on Earth without nature. Since humans have taken it for granted, we often don’t realize the importance of nature for human life, which is evident in how we treat the environment. However, understanding why nature is essential to humans and how it affects us is vital.</p></section>
